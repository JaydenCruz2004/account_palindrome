# Airline Account Palindrome Check

This C++ program simulates an airline account creation system. After the user enters their name, password, birthdate, and pin, the program checks if the entered password is a **palindrome** (reads the same forwards and backwards) using pointers. It demonstrates concepts like pointer manipulation, functions, and input validation.

## Features

- User input for passenger details: name, password, birthdate, and pin.
- A function to check if the password is a palindrome.
- Utilizes pointers to reference and manipulate string data.
- Validates user input to ensure correct data types are entered.

## Program Flow

1. The user is prompted to enter their account details (name, password, birthdate, and pin).
2. The program checks if the password is a palindrome.
3. The result is displayed, notifying the user if the password is a palindrome or not.

## Requirements

- **C++**: The program is written in C++ and should be compiled and run in any C++ environment.
- **Pointers**: The program demonstrates the use of pointers in functions to check for palindromes.
